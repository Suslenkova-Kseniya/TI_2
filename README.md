Stream ciphers LFSR
Implement a system of streaming encryption and decryption for a file with any content using a key sequence generator based on a linear shift register with feedback LFSR1 (the register size is given in Table 1). The initial state of the register is entered from the keyboard. The field for entering the state of the register must ignore any characters except 0 and 1. Display the generated key (a sequence of 0 and 1), the source file and the encrypted file in binary form. The program must not be written in console mode. The result of the program is an encrypted/decrypted file.
The power of a polynomial LFSR:	31
